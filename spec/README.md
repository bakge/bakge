Bakge File Format Specifications
================================

Bakge has its own file formats for various things, providing a simple and easy-to-use interface for users to load information from files into various structs or Bakge classes.

Every file format is semantically versioned, with major, minor and patch versions ranging from 0 to 9. This is to simplify the naming of structs representing handles for various file-versions.
