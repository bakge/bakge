 *
 * Bakge is a game engine and software project with two major goals. The first 
 * and foremost is to provide a partial and compact abstraction over OpenGL and 
 * other third-party libraries, to simplify programmatic approaches to game and 
 * game engine development using C++. The second is to provide a development
 * kit with which developers can create a 2D or 3D game using Lua, similar to
 * [Love2D](http://www.love2d.org).
