Hello, Bakge
============

In this tutorial we'll go through how to fork, clone build Bakge on Windows and Linux (we'll be using Ubuntu, but feel free to build on whatever flavor or distro tickles your fancy). Then we'll write create a simple "hello, world"-esque program using Bakge.


## Windows

What you'll need:

 - [CMake 2.6+](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html)
 - [git](http://git-scm.com/)
 - Visual Studio (I use 2010 but previous versions should work just fine)
 - A [GitHub](http://github.com) account

### 1) Fork Bakge

### 2) Clone your fork to your local machine
