{"name":"Bakge","tagline":"Bakersfield Game Engine is a framework for developing 2D/3D games and graphical applications.","body":"### Bakge\r\nBakersfield Game Engine is a library and development kit designed to simplify programmatic approaches to game, game engine and graphical application development. The SDK provides compiled libraries and runtime binaries for select platforms and compilers with which you can develop, maintain and build your own project. The GDK contains a ready-made engine and tool-chain for developing 2D and 3D games using Lua 5.1.\r\n\r\nTo build Bakge you must first install [CMake 2.6+](http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html) and [git](http://git-scm.com/).\r\n\r\n### Fork & Clone\r\nFirst, [fork](https://github.com/palistov/bakge/fork) Bakge, then clone it to your local machine with the following commands.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd repo_root\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bakge\r\n$ cd bakge\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Code\r\nIf you want to fix a bug or add a feature, it is best if you create a new branch off of [palistov/develop](https://github.com/palistov/bakge/tree/develop). This way it can easily be tested against the rest of the most recent features or bug fixes. You will want to keep [palistov/develop](https://github.com/palistov/bakge/tree/develop) updated in your repository, so you can merge recent changes into your own feature branches if necessary. Run these commands to keep up to date with Bakge's develop branch.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git remote add palistov https://github.com/palistov/bakge    # Run ONCE\r\n$ git fetch palistov develop\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce you have the most recent develop branch, check it out and create your own local branch in your repository so you can keep track of it. Remember to `git fetch palistov develop` often to keep it up to date!\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git checkout palistov/develop\r\n$ git checkout -b palistov-develop\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you can create your feature branch and start coding in your newest feature or bug fix. Once you have created your own local branch of palistov/develop, keep it up to date by fetching and pulling with `git pull palistov develop` while on your palistov-develop branch.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ git checkout -b my-feature\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Contribute\r\nOnce your awesome new feature or much-needed bug fix is complete, submit a pull request via Github. Most of the time the pull request won't be merged through Github itself, but it will be cloned to the official repository and merged in.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
