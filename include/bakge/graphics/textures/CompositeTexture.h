/*! @brief A special texture whose pixel data is built using four corner
 * textures, two gradients and a fill color. Best used for static UI elements
 * that share the same texture, like buttons or window bars.
 *
 * A special texture whose pixel data is built using 4 corner textures and
 * two gradients. The two gradients are used to fill the spaces directly
 * between the corner pieces (horizontally and vertically), and the fill
 * color fills the empty space left in the middle of the texture. There are
 * restrictions on the dimensions of these textures. The corner pieces must
 * be identical in scale, with their width equal to their height. The
 * horizontal and vertical gradients must be identical in scale with their
 * length equal to the width (and height) of the corner pieces and their
 * height equal to 1. The fill color must a single pixel (width 1, height 1).
 *
 * These textures area great for UI, so that when they are used to draw
 * static elements of different sizes, the texture is clear and crisp since
 * each texture is dynamically filled to be the same pixel size as the element
 * appears on-screen.
 *
 * For dynamic elements that change sizes often, it is better to instead split
 * the frame and texture's pieces (corners, gradients and fill) into 7
 * unique frames or textures, and bind and draw each of those individually
 * according to the proper scale, using the GL_NEAREST magnification filters
 * to maintain a clear, crisp texture on the element. This approach is a bit
 * more complicated since it requires managing the scales and positions of
 * not only the UI element as a whole, but each of its 7 "subframes". This
 * does provide some benefits over using a CompositeTexture in that you load
 * far less texture data into OpenGL and you can easily "re-skin" the element.
