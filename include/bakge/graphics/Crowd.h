/*! @brief A grouping of Pawns typically used for instanced rendering.
 *
 * Crowds are large groups of pawns that are drawn using instanced rendering
 * techniques, to avoid the large overhead associated with numerous draw calls.
 * The Crowd class provides a way to manage its members as a whole or as
 * individuals through various methods. Internally the Crowd uses a dynamically
 * allocated array to store data about its members.
 *
 * Typically the Crowd is used for instanced rendering, but it could also see
 * use as a storage class for arbitrary groups of Pawns or Nodes that don't
 * necessarily get rendered, such as pathing waypoints.
 *
 * When rendered using Mesh::DrawInstanced, Crowds use a different set of
 * shader attributes than Nodes or Pawns.
